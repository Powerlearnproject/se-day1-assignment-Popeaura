Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the prcess of  making software in a planned and organized way. It involves designing,developing and maintaining software to ensure it works well and meets user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Structured Programming - Introduced organized coding to make software easier to manage.
-Object-Oriented Programming - Used objects to bundle data and operations, making software more flexible.
-Embracing Agile methods- Promoted flexible and collaborative software development, focusing on adapting to changes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Research - Gather what the software needs to do.
-Design-Plan how the software will work.
-Implementation - Write the code.
-Testing -Check if the software works correctly.
-Deployment -Release the software for use.
-Maintenance -Fix issues that may occur during the cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall- Follows a set order of steps. Good for projects with clear, fixed requirements.
-Agile- Flexible and allows changes throughout. Great for projects with evolving needs.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Writes and fixes code.
- Tests the software to find and fix bugs.
-Manages projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)- Provide tools for coding, debugging, and managing projects in one place. Example is Visual Studio Code.
-VCS (Version Control Systems)- Track changes to code and help manage versions. Example is Git (with GitHub).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Some of the major challanges faced by web developers are   Bugs, unclear requirements, and project delays.
-SOme of the Strategies to use so as to be able to overcome these challanges are by ensuring  they conduct thorough testing, clear documentation, and regular communication.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit Testing- Tests individual parts of the code.
-Integration Testing- Checks if different parts of the software work together.
-System Testing- Tests the whole software system as a complete unit.
-Acceptance Testing- Ensures the software meets user needs and requirements.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models
-Prompt Engineering means  the process of creating clear questions or instructions to help AI give better answers. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague Prompt- Tell me about the weather.

-Improved Prompt -What is the weather forecast for Nairobi for the next three days?
-improvedd prompt is better since it is clear and specific on location and also time
-it is also better since it asks for a forcast not just general information
-It is Concise since it provides all needed details for a precise answer.
